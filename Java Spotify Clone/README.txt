CPS209-08 Assignment 2
----------------------
All methods and new functions should be working properly (including the bonus).

Just some clarifications:
 
all the functions new to assignment 2 are NOT case sensitive except for the bonus.
For example if you typed the command "searcha" and then entered "ALesSIa cARa", all songs by Alessia Cara would still come up
(It seemed to me it would make more sense to function like this). searchp (the bonus) is case sensitive because the rubric seems to imply it
should be, and it provides less random results. As an example if you entered "Ale" the book shogun would come up because the word "gale" is in one of
its chapters.

The updated download function works no matter which index you enter first, meaning if you enter a bigger index first they will just be swapped.
So entering from content 1 to 12 works the same as from content 12 to 1. I decided to program it like this because it seemed more convenient.

The rubric mentioned that podcasts are not part of assignment 2 so I commented out or removed all code related to podcasts.
If I was not meant to do this and it affects my mark then uh... oops I guess.

For some reason some of the comments from assignment 1 are missing despite being there before. Considering assignment 1 has already been
marked I didn't re-comment the old code, hopefully this is not a problem.

That's all, thank you!
