This file containsâ€¦

The main for the CIS1500 Student Finance Planner. The main contains an array of Finance Data structs which is used to store various Finance data, as well 3 integer variables for budgeting ratios which can be changed by the user.

The main also contains an infinite while loop which prompts the user for input based on a given menu, and uses functions from A3_Functions.c to manipulate and store Financial Data. The while loop/program can be exited by entering anything other than 1 2 3 4 or 5

***************************************************************
The program should be compiled using the following flags:
-std=c99
-Wall
-lm
Compiling:
gcc -Wall -std=c99 1170276A3.c A3_Functions.c -o A3 -lm
OR
gcc -Wall -std=c99 1170276A3.c A3_Functions.c -lm
Running the program:
./A3
OR
./a.out
